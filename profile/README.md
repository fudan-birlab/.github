## Brain-inspired Intelligent Robotics Lab @ Fudan University

Our mission is to investigate brain, intelligence, and robotics to uncover the core principles of intelligenceâ€”encompassing spatial cognition, memory, learning, decision-making, and locomotion. By integrating computational techniques, robotics, neuroscience, and behavioral research, we aim to develop robots with human-level spatial intelligence.

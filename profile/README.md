 <!-- Our mission is to advance interdisciplinary research at the convergence of brain science, artificial intelligence, and robotics. We investigate the neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition from the perspectives of spatial navigation, memory, learning, decision-making, and locomotion. By integrating computational modeling, robotics, neuroscience, and behavioral methods, we aim to develop robotic systems with human-like spatial intelligence. --> 

From the perspective of <strong>brain</strong>, <strong>intelligence</strong>, and <strong>robotics</strong>, 
we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying <strong>spatial cognition</strong> 
including spatial navigation, memory, learning, decision-making, and locomotion. 
By integrating computational, robotics, neural, and behavioral approaches, 
we aim to <strong>build robots</strong> with <strong>human-like spatial intelligence</strong>.

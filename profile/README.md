## Brain-inspired Intelligent Robotics Lab @ Fudan University

Our mission is to fuse brain, intelligence, and robotics to understand neural mechanisms of spatial cognition—spanning perception, learning, memory, decision-making, and locomotion—to build robots with human-level spatial intelligence via a combination of computational, robotics, neural, and behavioral approaches.
